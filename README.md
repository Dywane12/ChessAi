# ChessAi
Building a ChessAi in Python
So I want to build a Chess Ai in python, that at the end will have features such as:
- being able to select from different colors of the board
- being able to select what difficulty level the Ai will be at (3/4 levels)
- detect stale-mate, let you castle, be able to promote when pawn reaches the other side

This is my first project so it will probably take longer than it should, but I am looking forward to building this game
